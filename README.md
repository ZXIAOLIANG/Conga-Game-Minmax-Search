# Conga-Game-Minmax-Search
Using Min-Max algorithm to play Conga against a random agent

## Usage
I assume black moves first, and the maximum exploring depth each time is 2, which can be configured by changing `depth_limit` variable.

After running `python conga.py`, it will output the winner, the number of turns, the number of nodes explored, and maximum exploring depth each time.
